# Teeth Term Trivia Description
There are several terminologies that dentists and their staff use on a regular basis in the process of providing care to patients, managing patient records, and preparing claims. Several words are well-known, particularly to individuals with established dental expertise. However, new dentists and staff may not be as well-versed in the terminology, and as time passes, new phrases are introduced and old ones are changed for clarity. Teeth Term Trivia will serve as a fun interactive game that educates inexperienced dental students and those entering the dental industry.
